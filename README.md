# QPG

QPG is a question paper generator that reduces the load of the educators and allows them
to focus on quality teaching. By enabling the teachers to generate question papers without
any hassle, QPG frees them up to interact with students and solve their doubts. QPG is
useful for educational institutions like schools, NGOs, colleges and private tuitions.

# APP
QPG is a fully functioning, easy to use app which enables the teachers to make unique
papers for assessing and honing their studentâ€™s skills. The QPG App runs in the browser. The
teachers select the subject, chapter and number of questions and a customized question
paper is generated in seconds. The questions are selected from a large pool of questions
inbuilt in QPG. This database of questions can also be enhanced by the educators.
# Saved Question Paper
The question paper generated by the teachers is saved in their laptop so that they can
access it whenever they want.
# Customization
Teachers have complete control over what goes in their question paper including the length
of questions and chapters. 
# Database
QPG needs a database of questions to work.
